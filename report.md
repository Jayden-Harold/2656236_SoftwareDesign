In this lab, I started by created a repository on GitHub - 2656236_Software Design.
The following work was completed:
I created the file student-info.txt with my student number (2656236) and name (Jayden Harold)
I created the index.html file and added the <h1> tag with the text, "Hello world, I am 2656236". When committing this message, I used the special commit message, "feat: Initial commit with student files".
I added a paragraph to index.html with the commit message "Added paragraph to index.html"
